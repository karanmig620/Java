// instance variables
these are the variables that we create outside the class 
// we can also use the access specifier 
// cant use these in any other class or from anywhere as we are using private accessifier

private int attributes = 4 ;

// how to call these instance variables from anywhere
// we use getters and setters
// getter:- create a method to get the values of instance variables of the class .
 // setters:- create a method to set the values of instance variables of the class .
 
  
 //access specifier must be public in order to get the value and no return type so 
 always use default data type
 
// how to call getters
 public int getarguments() {
 
 return arguments;
 }
 
// setters, we do have return type in setters so we will use void as the return type
and also we have to pass the parameters

// we can use if/else statements here also in order to use the variables
if(arguments ==0){
return;
}
this.arguments = arguments;   //here this refers to the instance variable inorder to set the variables.
}

// constructors

constructors are by defalut there when we create a new object
// or simple words to initialize the object of that class, we can also make the default empty constructor as custom constructor

public Boxer {    //(object name)
// initilise it here
